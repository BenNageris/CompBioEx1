Intro:
In this model, we model the rumor spread process using cell automaton under several rules and limitations.
In this project, we created a GUI interface & program to model this behaviour and test the influence of different hyperparameters on the spread mechanism and characteristics.
The simulation was created using Python & pygame.


Execution Steps:
	1. git clone https://github.com/BenNageris/CompBioEx1
	2. cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
	3. pip3.10 install -r requirements.txt
	4. python .\pygame_frontend.py
		(Note that we executed this project with python3.10 & python3.9 - but lower versions might work too)


(*) We tested this program on a Windows PC & Linux Ubuntu with Python 3.10 & python3.9 installed.
